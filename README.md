# my-first-custom-blog

This Project was actually the very first real life project I did. 
It is just a simple blog, nothing too complex.
To install it just pull the repo or download as zip;
Then make sure you have xammp installed.
Import the database into Phpmyadmin and do any other relevant setup,
Then run file on localhost!

I will welcome any contribution. 

Note: I haven't modified this code since it was write
